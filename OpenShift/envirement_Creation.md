  - 2.4.3 Configure users and permissions.
  
- **2.5** Define tasks for OpenShift installation.
  - 2.5.1 Download and install OpenShift binaries.
  - 2.5.2 Set up configurations and certificates.
  
- **2.6** Post-installation tasks.
  - 2.6.1 Deploy internal OpenShift router and registry.
  - 2.6.2 Set up storage solutions, if any (like NFS, iSCSI).
  - 2.6.3 Configure logging and monitoring agents.

## 3. OpenShift OKD Deployment Using Ansible:

### a. Pre-deployment:
- **3.1** Test connectivity.
  - 3.1.1 Use `ansible -m ping` to ensure all nodes are reachable.
  - 3.1.2 Fix any SSH or connectivity issues.
  
- **3.2** Dry-run the playbook.
  - 3.2.1 Use the `--check` flag with Ansible to perform a dry-run.
  - 3.2.2 Review outputs for any potential issues or errors.

### b. Deployment:
- **3.3** Execute the Ansible playbook.
  - 3.3.1 Monitor the output, noting any failed tasks.
  - 3.3.2 Check logs in case of failures and adjust playbook accordingly.

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification:
- **4.1** Access the OpenShift console.
  - 4.1.1 Navigate to the provided URL after installation.
  - 4.1.2 Log in using default credentials and change them.
  
- **4.2** Deploy a test application.
  - 4.2.1 Use sample templates or containers.
  - 4.2.2 Check if the application is accessible and running correctly.
  
- **4.3** Test OpenShift functionalities.
  - 4.3.1 Scale the test application and observe the behavior.
  - 4.3.2 Review logs, metrics, and monitoring dashboards.

## 5. Ongoing Management:

### a. Updates & Maintenance:
- **5.1** Schedule periodic playbook runs.
  - 5.1.1 Use tools like `cron` for regular updates.
  - 5.1.2 Monitor outputs for issues.
  
- **5.2** Backup configurations and data.
  - 5.2.1 Determine backup frequency (daily, weekly).
  - 5.2.2 Store backups in secure, redundant storage.

### b. Scaling & Optimization:
- **5.3** Modify the playbook for future changes.
  - 5.3.1 Add tasks for new nodes or resources.
  - 5.3.2 Adjust configurations for performance or security.
  
- **5.4** Regularly monitor cluster health.
  - 5.4.1 Use integrated tools or external solutions like Prometheus.
  - 5.4.2 Act on alerts and optimize resources as necessary.

## 6. Cleanup and Teardown:
- **6.1** Run cleanup tasks.
  - 6.1.1 Stop and delete applications and services.
  - 6.1.2 Remove nodes or decommission resources.
  
- **6.2** Ensure resources are returned to their initial state.
  - 6.2.1 Verify all nodes are free of OpenShift components.
  - 6.2.2 Check storage and network configurations.
